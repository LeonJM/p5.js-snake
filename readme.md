# Hi all

Firtsly, I'm suprised I made this in ~3hrs. > yeet.

`canvasWidth` and `canvasHeight` from `index.html` can be adjusted
to your preferences as there are no magic numbers in the code.

I think the code is pretty self-explanatory so this readme ain't
gonna be too useful.

One notable functionality is the way the snake grows using arrays `shift` and `unshift` and `push`.
And the other is the "tracker" that prevents the fruit/apple to spawn not on the snake.
